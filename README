stfuboot -- Bootloader for STM32 connectivity line devices
==========================================================

The stfuboot project aims to create an open-source replacement for a
bootloader that is factory programmed into the System Memory of the
connectivity line deivces

This bootlader has been tested to at least partially work with the following microcontrollers:
 - STM32F107

The library is written based on example founf in
libopencm3(https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3). The code tested
to build with CodeSourcery toolchain

Building
--------
In order to build the code the symlink to libopencm3 directory has to be created:

 $ ln -s <path to libopencm3> libopencm3

After that building should be as simple as:

 $ make

You may want to override the toolchain (e.g., arm-elf or arm-none-eabi):

 $ PREFIX=arm-none-eabi make

For a more verbose build you can use

 $ make V=1

Coding style and development guidelines
---------------------------------------

The code is written using the Linux kernel coding style, see
http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle for details.

Please use the same style for any code contributions, thanks!
